1) Make a connection when client starts so that you dont need to send the ip and port for each share reqest
2) Use share pointers in the tracker map
3) Do 2 threads open connection on different port?
4) Add error handling while setting up sockets(might throw bad argument error)
5) while sending file, check if it is the last chunk
